These plugintools were built on Jan 07, 2009.
They were built from the Lockss source code in the public
CVS repository.
Here is the info on the build version number:
 $Id: build.xml,v 1.242 2008/12/30 17:47:41 tlipkis Exp $
 Ant build file for LOCKSS daemon

Normally the release is available on the public Lockss website, and they
should be retrieved from Lockss.  They were built and put on the MetaArchive
website because a bug was fixed in the code, put Lockss did not have a chance
to update the public website and sourceforge. 

They were built on the server wilson.library.emory.edu
The following software must be installed on the server and must have
their HOME variable set.
JAVA	JAVA_HOME=/usr/java/jdk1.5.0_10
ANT	ANT_HOME=/usr/local/apache-ant-1.6.5

If these are set then you can proceed to download the software and build
the plugintool packages as follows.

1)  mkdir plugtool
2)  cd plugtool
3)  export CVSROOT=:pserver:anonymous@lockss.cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/lockss
4)  cvs get -P lockss-daemon
5)  cd lockss-daemon
6)  ant package-plugintool

This should give you a success message and you should see two files, as follows:
[brobbi2@wilson lockss-daemon]$ ll plugintoo*
-rw-rw-r--  1 brobbi2 brobbi2 14952079 Jan  7 16:53 plugintool.tgz
-rw-rw-r--  1 brobbi2 brobbi2 14951949 Jan  7 16:53 plugintool.zip

The .tgz is for Linux and the .zip is for Windows.
