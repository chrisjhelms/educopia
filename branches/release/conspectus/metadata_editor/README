This metadata editor is run as the companion to the ruby based 
conspectus which takes care of the overall organization of content 
and the metadata directly related to running a LOCKSS network. The
metadata editor code in this directory takes care of additional 
collecion metadata. The code in subersion is setup to run with a
conspectus instance at http://conspectus.metaarchive.org

FILES  

*.php                    web ui files
mysql_includes.php       has the database info, name, user, password, ... 
includes/header.html     header file for edit.php and view.php; 
includes/footer.html     footer file for edit.php and view.php; 
                         header and footer use the $conspectus_url defined in config.php to 
                         adjust links in header and footer 
cleanup.php 		 run periodically to clean up empty stary collections 
                         that result from too many exceutions of create.php  

show_all.xsl             assumes that this is the metadata editor for consptus.metaarchive.org 
                         links need to be adjusted when this is used with conspectoy.metaarchive.org

INSTALL 
   create a database 
   use sql comands to upload the files in db.migration (in the order of their dates) 
   copy mysql_includes-defaults.php to in mysql_includes.php (do not add lines!)
   fill in the values in mysql_includes.php

To install a metadata editor for a different conspectus 
instance as is done for conspectoy.metaarchive.org, you need to 
configure each archive the conspectus companion instance such 
that it knows how to fullfill create, view, and edit operations.

     URL_OF_THIS_SITE/create.php
     URL_OF_THIS_SITE/edit.php?coll_id=<ID>&title=<TITLE>
     URL_OF_THIS_SITE/view.php?coll_id=<ID>&title=<TITLE>

You also need to edit two files:

show_all.xsl:
  replace all occurences of  
	http://conspectus.metaarchive.org
  with the url of the companion conspectus instance  
 
config.php
  replace 
        $conspectus_url  = "http://conspectus.metaarchive.org"; 
  with 
        $conspectus_url  = "COMPANION CONSPECTUS URL"
 

A good approach to installing: 
*) check code out in its own directory 
   svn co https://metaarchive.org/svn/metaarchive/tools.metaarchive.org/branches/cloud/conspectus/php DIRECTORY 
*) make the changes described above 
*) make sure those changes can not be checked in by making the .svn directory contents read only
