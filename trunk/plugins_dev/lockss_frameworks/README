run_one_daemon runs a standalone development daemon.  Useful for testing
basic daemon behavior through the UI, and crawling behavior of plugins
(crawl rules, URL normalizers, etc.).

This README file has three secions: 
SETUP, USAGE, TOURBLE SHOOTING 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SETUP: 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If you want to use run_one_daemon 
  to work on a new, test, or released plugins please check them out from the 
  respective subversion branch which are documented on the metawiki at 
  http://code.google.com/p/metaarchive/wiki/SVNLayout
  run the command: 
           svn co SVN-URL-FOR-PLUGIN-XML  plugins 
  Refer to the checkout Instructions under te Source tab to learn about
  checkout details: http://code.google.com/p/metaarchive/source/checkout

After setting up the plugins directory update the configuration 
  ./update_config  
         # creates metaarchive_plugins.xml, metaarchive_aus.xml, metaarchive_plugins.jar

ArchivalUnit definitions are retrieved from the MetaArchive 
   * conspectus  (http://metaarchive.org/conspectus)
    * all archives, all archival units in test or restest status
   * conspectoy  (http://metaarchive.org/conspectoy
    * all archival units in test status from the DOC archive 

The daemon uses the user name and password combination lockss-u/lockss-p

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
USAGE: 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To run the daemon: 
  ./start
  ...   (connect to daemon on port 8081)
  ./stop

You can also start the daemon without the predefined titles from metaarchive_aus.xml 
  ./start -notitle 

./clean removes all files written by the LOCKSS daemon (log files, cache content, ...) with the current exception of 
test/frameworks/run_one_daemon/derby.log
test/frameworks/run_one_daemon/export
This file and directory should be manually deleted after running the ./clean script

./check checks whether the xml config files are proper xml 
        and normally prints whether the daemon is running (as indicated by the dpid file) 
        - the script is in need of updates to accurately report whether the daemon is running

To add a new/changed plugins to the LOCKSS daemon's configuration 
and/or to update the daemons archival units list on the basis of conspectus data
   svn up plugins 
   rerun ./update_config and restart the daemon 

Adding predefined titles is done slightly different from regular caches. 
You need to go to 'Journal Configuration | Manual Add/Edit' instead of 
'Journal Configuration | Add Titles '
 
To add a predefined archival unit: 
  direct your browser to  http://localhost:8081
  choose 'Journal Configuration | Manual Add/Edit ' 
  push 'Add' button 
  select AU from 'Choose a title' drop down list 
  push 'Continue' 
  push 'Create' 

To add an archival unit manually: 
  direct your browser to  http://localhost:8081
  choose 'Journal Configuration | Manual Add/Edit ' 
  push 'Add' button 
  choose a plugin from the drop down list 
  push 'Continue' 
  fill the form with appropiate parameter values 

To start a Crawl on an ArchivalUnit 
  direct your browser to  http://localhost:8081/DebugPanel
  choose AU from 'AU Actions: select AU" drop down list 
  push 'Start Crawl' 


Always commit changes to your plugins to subversion 


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
EXPERT USAGE:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The ./clean commend deletes all files stored by run_one_daemon for all 
archival_units. If you wish to delete an single archival unit along with all
files stored bythe daemon: 
   * access the daemons 'Repositories' list under 'Damon Status' and 
     determine the directory under which content is stored 
   * delete the archival unit from the daemons 'Journal Configurations'
     with the 'Remove Titles' option 
   * stop the daemon 
   * recursively remove the directory you foudn in step 1: 
     rm -rf ./caches/dir_name_found 
   * restart the daemon  
   * check whether the archival unit is in fact gone in the 'AuIds' Table under 
     'Daemon Status'
   * add the archival unit back into the daemons 'Journal Configurations'
     with the 'Add Titles' option


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TROUBLESHOOTING
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To see which daemons are running use: ps aux | fgrep LockssDaemon
Make sure there is always at most one daemon active. 

The start script sometimes complains that a daemon is already running because 
the dpid file exists, but the daemon process did in fact die without cleaning 
the dpid file up. Remove dpid and try again if this is the case. Be careful not to start more than one LOCKSS daemon. 

If you have no idea what is going on check the LOCKSS daemons log messages 
in test.out. 

-----
Dealing with IP connection error: 
-----
On some systems daemons produce the following error upon startup: 
Warning: 4-IpAccess: Error checking IP: org.lockss.util.IpFilter$MalformedException: Illegal number: "0:0:0:0:0:0:0:1" at org.lockss.util.IpFilter$Mask.<init>(IpFilter.java:216)
This is due to an operating system configuration which enables the IP version
6 (ipv6) protocol. IPv6 must be disabled for the LOCKSS daemons to start: 
This was fixed under UBUNTU by adding the line:
    'net.ipv6.conf.all.disable_ipv6=1' 
to the file /etc/sysctl.conf
