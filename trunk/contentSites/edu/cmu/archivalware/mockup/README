initial archivalware docs from 2000

metaarchivePermission.html   2012010101 => Jan 1 2012 

auids/{number}.*    auid pages  xml  and html
records/{number}.*  record pages  xml  and html
collections/51.*    heinz collection page  xml and html 

auids/*/changes.html   
	use If-Modified-Since Header value or given date parameter 
	to compute changes between current archival unit status and 
	the given date 
	may assume that the date parameter does not lie in the future 
	the pages timestamp is the current date == date of request 


xml and html have the same information - just in different formats 
xml and html pages have the same last nodified 

in this mockup we show lastmodified as a metadata field in all xml files 
-------------------------------

timestamp of record, auid, collection html pages same as 
lastmodified of corresponding xml page

lastmodified of record  based on 
   lastmodified of documents related to record
   of last date of a metadata field change 

lastmodified of auid = closest lastmodified of enclosed records 
lastmodified of collection = closest lastmodified of enclosed auids
