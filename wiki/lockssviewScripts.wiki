#summary lockssview commandline scripts

= Lockssview Commandline Scripts  = 

The metaarchive user has several lks commands defined in its bin directory
that serve as convenience functions for calling lockssview scripts:

~metaarchive/bin/lkscaches is equivalent to
~metaarchive/tools/lockssview/scripts.py caches

~metaarchive/bin/lksreport_auprofile is equivalent to
~metaarchive/tools/lockssview/scripts.py  report_auprofile

To list all available lks commands type lks and then hit the TAB key.
Alternatively you can call the command: lksscripts

Commands access the lockssview MySQL database, currently (Jan,2013) the
database is available on data.metaarchive.org only, and therefore commands do
execute successfuly only on the data server.  

All commands accept the following options: 
 --help
    The usage messages printed are available at usage/....txt 
 --version 
    Versions correspond to the subversion revision of a scripts last commit.
 -c filename 
    Scripts read the given file name and parse options defined in the [Status] section as configuration parameters; users may give multiple configuration files.  See the cachestatus.rc example file. 


== EXAMPLE USAGE  == 

=== Caches ===   

Print help message 
 lkscaches --help 

Print all defined caches 
 lkscaches 

Print the names of caches only
 lkscaches  -n 

Print the only production network caches
  lkscaches -N production 

Print the docmain names of production network caches
 lkscaches -N production -D


=== CacheStatus  ===
lkscachestatus is the work horse for retrieving status information from LOCKSS
caches and for printing cache specific information to tab separated files

When retrieving information a user must define 
* at least one cache from which to retrieve information 
* username and password to access cache user interface  
* which LOCKSS UI status table to access: auidlist, ausummary, urllists, and/or crawlstatus 
* when retrieving ausummary, urllists, or crawlstatus info : which archival units are of interest

Retrieve the list of known auids  from the aub-dell server 
The server parameter may either be a cache name or a cache's domain name 
 lkscachestatus -a getauidlist -u user -p pwd -S aub-dell 

Get ausummary  and crawlstatus info for all aus known to the aub-dell cache
 lkscachestatus -a getausummary -a getcrawlstatus --all  -u user -p pwd -S aub-dell 

Get urllist for all aus starting with edu.auburn  and crawlstatus info for all aus known to the aub-dell cache
 lkscachestatus -a geturllist -P edu.auburn  -u user -p pwd -S aub-dell 

Get urllists for 
edu|auburn|glomeratatif2&base_url~http%3A%2F%2Fdigdata1%2Elib%2Eauburn%2Eedu%2Fglomeratas%2F&year~1928
if the info stored in the database is older than 3 days = 72 hours 
 lkscachestatus -a geturllist -u user -p pwd -S aub-dell 'edu|auburn|glomeratatif2&base_url~http%3A%2F%2Fdigdata1%2Elib%2Eauburn%2Eedu%2Fglomeratas%2F&year~192'
Note that refreshing the urllist info includes refreshing ausuammry info. 
urllist and ausuammry information is only requested from the cache if the
stored information is outdated; runnig the command a second time will NOT
update the information again. 


=== Using a configuration file  ===

All command read a configiration file that matches there name. Additional
configurations can be read from files passed to commands with the -c option: 
cachestatus.rc is an example configuration file.
